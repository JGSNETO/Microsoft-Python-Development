    "# Activity: Working with a list\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're heading to the grocery store, but you keep forgetting items you need. It's frustrating and leads to multiple trips! Wouldn't it be great to have a digital helper to keep track of your shopping list? \n",
    "\n",
    "That's where Python comes in. You'll build a simple program that lets you add items to your virtual grocery list, load items from a CSV file, and manage your shopping list efficiently. No more forgotten milk or eggs!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this activity is to introduce you to the practical application of Python lists, which are like ordered containers that store collections of items. You'll learn how to create, manipulate, and interact with lists, gaining hands-on experience with essential programming concepts. You'll see how lists are perfect for grocery shopping because they maintain the order of items, allow you to easily add or remove things as needed, and can even store different types of information (like item names and quantities). \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use special actions called methods, such as append() and remove(), to efficiently manage your list. In addition, you'll explore how to load data from external files, such as comma-separated values (CSV) into your Python program, further expanding your data handling capabilities. By the end of this activity, you'll have a functional digital grocery list and a solid foundation in working with lists, a fundamental data structure in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this activity, you will answer quiz questions to receive a grade for this activity. You will not need to submit a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Download PYTC1M2P01_Activity_Workingwithalist.zip and save it on your machine’s desktop and extract it to a folder where it is easily accessible. Note that this ZIP archive has multiple files in it, so it must be extracted. If you just \"open\" the Jupyter Notebook, you may get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Load Your Initial Grocery List from a CSV File\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started by loading your existing grocery list from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. Think of a CSV file as a simple spreadsheet where each row represents an item on your list. We'll use the pandas library, a powerful tool for working with data in Python, to read the CSV file and extract the items into a Python list.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSV file ('grocery_list.csv') containing an initial set of grocery items has already been provided for you. You do not need to change the code for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessary code to import the pandas library, load the CSV file, and extract its content into a Python list named grocery_list is also present. You will not need to change this code either. You will see the pandas library again in a future course.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simply run the cell to print the contents of the grocery_list and observe the output.\n",
    "- You should see a list of groceries.\n",
    "- If you receive the following error:\n",
    "- Error: The file 'grocery_list.csv' was not found in the current directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have extracted the contents of the ZIP folder as outlined above."
