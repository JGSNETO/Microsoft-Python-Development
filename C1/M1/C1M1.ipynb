    "\n",
    "- Python is more concise and reads naturally. Pythion is versatile. \n",
    "- Used for web development, data analysis to artificial intelligence and machine learning. \n",

    "## Programming Fundamentals \n",
    "\n",
    "- The simplest definition of programming is that it's the way people communicate with computers and instruct them to perform tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programming fundamentals:\n",
    "1. Variables: Containers to store data. \n",
    "2. Data types: Define the different type of data that variables can hold. \n",
    "3. Operators: Common operators(Arithmetic, Logical)\n",
    "4. Control flow statements: Determine the order the code is executed. \n",
    "5. Functions: Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks, breaking down complex actions in small and more simple activities. \n",

    "## Explaining Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python defining characteristics:\n",
    "1. *Interpreted language*: Python code is executed, line by line, by an interpreter. This is different from compiled languages like C++ or Java, where the entire code is converted to machine code before it is executed. You can run and see the result directly, without a extra compilation step. \n",
    "2. *High-level language*: Focus on the logic of your program, rather than the details of how the computer executes it. \n",
    "3. *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)*: Paradigm that organizes code around data structures that contain both data and functions. Which are called objects. Objects promote code reusability, modularity, and maintainability, making it easier to manage and scale large software projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The beauty of Python´s syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python relies on indentation, using spaces or tabs, to define the structure of the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Data types: the building blocks of your code*:\n",
    "1. Numbers: Numerical values and floating pointing numbers, you would use integers. \n",
    "2. Strings: When you need to work with text. E.g: (\"Hello\"), (\"How are you\").\n",
    "3. Booleans: True or False. \n",
    "4. Lists: Store multiple values in a specific order. \n",
    "5. Dictionaries: Allow you to associate values with keys. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Syntax is the set of rules that govern how you arrange workds and symbols in Python to create meaningful instructions. \n",
    "1. Indentation: Spaces in the beggining of the code line. Each level of indentation creates a nested block, making it easier to identify which statements belong together. \n",
    "2. Statements: Commands or instructions. Form the logic of your code. \n",

    "# How Python code is interpreted\n",
    "Learning to code can feel like embarking on a grand adventure. You're about to gain the power to create, to automate, and to solve problems in ways you might not have imagined before. And like any good adventure, it all starts with one step. In this case, that step is running your very first Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you'll primarily be using Jupyter Notebooks in this course, it's important to understand how a Python program executes at a fundamental level. Jupyter provides a fantastic, interactive environment for writing and running Python code, allowing you to combine code, visualizations, and explanatory text all in one place. However, gaining familiarity with the command line and the Python interpreter will provide a solid foundation for your programming journey and enhance your ability to troubleshoot issues effectively. Jupyter allows you to combine code, visualizations, and explanatory text all in one place, making it an ideal tool for learning and experimentation. Think of it as a digital notebook where you can jot down your code, see the results immediately, and explain your thought process along the way. You can even include headings, images, and links, making your notebooks truly your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before we explore the world of Jupyter, it's essential to understand the underlying mechanism of how a Python program executes. It's like learning the basics of how an engine works before you get behind the wheel of a car. It gives you a deeper appreciation for what's happening under the hood and empowers you to troubleshoot problems more effectively. This foundational knowledge will serve you well as you progress to more complex projects and encounter unexpected challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this understanding in mind, let's open our text editor and explore how to write and execute Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From text to action: How Python programs run\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, let's understand what we mean by \"running a Python program.\" The code you write in a text editor is essentially just a set of instructions written in a language that Python understands. But these instructions are just text in a document. To bring those instructions to life, we need something to read and execute them. That \"something\" is the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the interpreter as a translator and executor rolled into one. It reads your Python code, line by line, and translates it into instructions that your computer's processor can understand and act upon. It's like having a chef who takes your recipe (the code) and translates it into a series of actions to create a delicious dish (the program's output).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The command line: Your direct line to the interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the interpreter to do its thing, we need a way to give it our Python code. This is where the command line comes in. The command line (also known as the terminal or shell) is a text-based interface for interacting with your computer. It might seem a bit intimidating at first, with its stark black screen and blinking cursor, but it's a powerful tool that gives you direct control over your system. Imagine it as a direct line of communication to your computer, allowing you to give it instructions in its own language."
