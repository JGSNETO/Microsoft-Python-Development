    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome to the world of programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is more concise and reads naturally. Pythion is versatile. \n",
    "- Used for web development, data analysis to artificial intelligence and machine learning. \n",
    "- Data analysis: Pandas and NumPy\n",
    "- Web development: Django and Flask\n",
    "- AI: Scikit-learn and PyTorch. \n",

    "## Programming Fundamentals \n",
    "\n",
    "- The simplest definition of programming is that it's the way people communicate with computers and instruct them to perform tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programming fundamentals:\n",
    "1. Variables: Containers to store data. \n",
    "2. Data types: Define the different type of data that variables can hold. \n",
    "3. Operators: Common operators(Arithmetic, Logical)\n",
    "4. Control flow statements: Determine the order the code is executed. \n",
    "5. Functions: Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks, breaking down complex actions in small and more simple activities. \n",

    "## Explaining Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python defining characteristics:\n",
    "1. *Interpreted language*: Python code is executed, line by line, by an interpreter. This is different from compiled languages like C++ or Java, where the entire code is converted to machine code before it is executed. You can run and see the result directly, without a extra compilation step. \n",
    "2. *High-level language*: Focus on the logic of your program, rather than the details of how the computer executes it. \n",
    "3. *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)*: Paradigm that organizes code around data structures that contain both data and functions. Which are called objects. Objects promote code reusability, modularity, and maintainability, making it easier to manage and scale large software projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The beauty of Python´s syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python relies on indentation, using spaces or tabs, to define the structure of the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Data types: the building blocks of your code*:\n",
    "1. Numbers: Numerical values and floating pointing numbers, you would use integers. \n",
    "2. Strings: When you need to work with text. E.g: (\"Hello\"), (\"How are you\").\n",
    "3. Booleans: True or False. \n",
    "4. Lists: Store multiple values in a specific order. \n",

    "# How Python code is interpreted\n",
    "Learning to code can feel like embarking on a grand adventure. You're about to gain the power to create, to automate, and to solve problems in ways you might not have imagined before. And like any good adventure, it all starts with one step. In this case, that step is running your very first Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you'll primarily be using Jupyter Notebooks in this course, it's important to understand how a Python program executes at a fundamental level. Jupyter provides a fantastic, interactive environment for writing and running Python code, allowing you to combine code, visualizations, and explanatory text all in one place. However, gaining familiarity with the command line and the Python interpreter will provide a solid foundation for your programming journey and enhance your ability to troubleshoot issues effectively. Jupyter allows you to combine code, visualizations, and explanatory text all in one place, making it an ideal tool for learning and experimentation. Think of it as a digital notebook where you can jot down your code, see the results immediately, and explain your thought process along the way. You can even include headings, images, and links, making your notebooks truly your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before we explore the world of Jupyter, it's essential to understand the underlying mechanism of how a Python program executes. It's like learning the basics of how an engine works before you get behind the wheel of a car. It gives you a deeper appreciation for what's happening under the hood and empowers you to troubleshoot problems more effectively. This foundational knowledge will serve you well as you progress to more complex projects and encounter unexpected challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this understanding in mind, let's open our text editor and explore how to write and execute Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From text to action: How Python programs run\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, let's understand what we mean by \"running a Python program.\" The code you write in a text editor is essentially just a set of instructions written in a language that Python understands. But these instructions are just text in a document. To bring those instructions to life, we need something to read and execute them. That \"something\" is the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the interpreter as a translator and executor rolled into one. It reads your Python code, line by line, and translates it into instructions that your computer's processor can understand and act upon. It's like having a chef who takes your recipe (the code) and translates it into a series of actions to create a delicious dish (the program's output).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The command line: Your direct line to the interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the interpreter to do its thing, we need a way to give it our Python code. This is where the command line comes in. The command line (also known as the terminal or shell) is a text-based interface for interacting with your computer. It might seem a bit intimidating at first, with its stark black screen and blinking cursor, but it's a powerful tool that gives you direct control over your system. Imagine it as a direct line of communication to your computer, allowing you to give it instructions in its own language.\n",

    "# Anatomy of a Python Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, celebrated for its simple syntax and remarkable versatility, has cemented its place as a fundamental tool in the software development landscape. Whether you're creating a concise script or architecting a complex web application, a solid grasp of the foundational components of a Python program is the key to laying the proper foundation for those tasks. Let’s begin an in-depth exploration of these components – statements, expressions, and the transformative potential of automation – and discover how they empower you to generate efficient and refined code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statements: The commands that orchestrate your code´s symphony\n",
    "Imagine you're guiding an orchestra. You use specific gestures and cues to direct each musician, creating a harmonious symphony. In Python, these cues are comparable to statements. The individual lines of code serve as instructions, dictating the actions your computer should perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment statement \n",
    "The line age = 25 assigns the numerical value 25 to the variable age. This is like setting up a character in a play, establishing their initial state. Variables act as containers for storing data, allowing you to reference and manipulate that data throughout your program. In this case, the variable age holds the age of the person we're evaluating.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional statements and comparison operators\n",
    "The if age >= 18: and else: statements introduce decision points. The computer evaluates the condition (age >= 18) and then executes the corresponding block of code based on whether the condition is true or false. This is how we create branching paths in our programs, much like a choose-your-own-adventure story. Conditional statements allow us to adapt the behavior of our code based on specific circumstances. For instance, we only print the \"You are eligible to vote\" message in our example if the age variable meets the minimum voting age requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of these conditions lies with comparison operators. In our example, >= (greater than or equal to) is a comparison operator that checks the relationship between age and 18. Other common comparison operators include == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), and < (less than). The != operator, specifically, checks if two values are not the same, such as if user_input != \"quit\": to continue a program until a specific word is typed. These operators are fundamental because they produce a Boolean result (either True or False), which is exactly what conditional statements need to decide which path to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial to remember that a single equals sign (=) is used for assignment (giving a variable a value, like age = 25), while a double equals sign (==) is used for comparison (checking if two values are the same). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Print statements\n",
    "The lines print(\"You are eligible to vote.\") and print(\"You are not yet eligible to vote.\") display messages to the user. These are our way of communicating the results of our computations or providing feedback to the user. Print statements are essential for interacting with users, debugging code, and presenting information in a readable format."

    "# Additional statement types\n",
    "Python offers an extensive collection of statements, each tailored for distinct programming needs. Let’s review these additional types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loop statements\n",
    "Loop statements, such as for and while, empower us to automate repetitive tasks by executing code blocks multiple times. Imagine needing to print each item in a shopping list—a for loop effortlessly iterates through the list, printing each item without manual intervention. This repetition streamlines code and saves valuable development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function definitions\n",
    "These statements create reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They encapsulate a set of instructions under a name, allowing you to call the function later in your program whenever you need to perform that task. Suppose you frequently calculate the area of a circle; defining a function calculate_area(radius)neatly packages the formula, promoting code organization and reusability. Functions enhance code readability and maintainability by abstracting complex logic into manageable units. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Class definitions\n",
    "Finally, class definitions form the foundation of object-oriented programming in Python. They serve as blueprints for creating objects, mirroring real-world entities within your code. Consider modeling a car; a Car class defines attributes like color, make, and model, along with methods like start_engine() and accelerate(). Classes foster modular, reusable code by encapsulating data and behavior, enabling the creation of complex, interactive programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions: The calculations that underpin your code's logic\n",
    "While statements are the commands that direct your program, expressions are the calculations that occur within those commands. They are the mathematical equations or logical operations that produce values. Basic arithmetic operations\n",

    "Floor Division // Performs division and discards any remainder, resulting in a whole number (so 7 // 4 is 1, as 4 goes into 7 a single time evenly). May also be referred to as integer division.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modulo % Returns the remainder after integer division (so 7 % 4 is 3, as the division has a remainder of 3).\n",

    "- 1 - discount is a more complex expression that calculates the discount percentage (for example, a discount of 20% means the price is 80% of the original cost). This demonstrates how expressions can be combined using operators like subtraction. The parentheses are used to control the order of operations, ensuring that the discount is subtracted from 1 before the multiplication takes place.\n",
